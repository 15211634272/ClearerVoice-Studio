# Configuration for generating Noisy Speech Dataset

# - test: Specify if creating data for test, if False, creating data for training
# - audioformat: default is .wav
# - min_audio_length: Minimum Length of each audio clip (noisy and clean speech) in seconds that will be generated by augmenting utterances. 
# - max_audio_length: Maximum Length of each audio clip (noisy and clean speech) in seconds that will be generated by augmenting utterances.
# - silence_length: Duration of silence introduced between clean speech utterances.
# - total_hours: Total number of hours of data required. Units are in hours. 
# - snr_lower: Lower bound for SNR required (default: 0 dB)
# - snr_upper: Upper bound for SNR required (default: 15 dB)
# - random_snr: randomly generate one SNR mixer bounded between snr_lower and snr_upper
# - total_snrlevels: Number of SNR levels to be generated if random_snr is False (default: 2, which means there are 2 levels between snr_lower and snr_upper)
# - noise_list: A path to the noise script file
# - save_noise: save background noise files, default: False
