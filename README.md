## Contents of this repository
This repository is organized into three main components: **[ClearVoice](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice)**, **[Train](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/train)**, and **[SpeechScore](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/speechscore)**.

### 1. **ClearVoice**  
ClearVoice offers a user-friendly  solution for speech denoising, separation, and extraction. Designed as a unified inference platform, it leverages our pre-trained models (e.g., [FRCRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07293), [MossFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11824)) for speech enhancement, separation, and audio-visual target speaker extraction tasks, all trained on extensive datasets. If you're looking for a tool to improve speech quality, ClearVoice is the perfect choice. Simply click on [`ClearVoice`](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice) and follow our detailed instructions to get started.

### 2. **Train**  
For advanced researchers and developers, we provide model finetune and training scripts for all the tasks offerred in ClearVoice and more:

- **[Speech enhancement](train/speech_enhancement)** (16kHz & 48kHz)
- **[Speech separation](train/speech_separation)** (8kHz & 16kHz)
- **[Target speaker extraction](train/target_speaker_extraction)** (16kHz)
  - **Audio-only Speaker Extraction Conditioned on a Reference Speech**
  - **Audio-visual Speaker Extraction Conditioned on Face (Lip) Recording**
  - **Audio-visual Speaker Extraction Conditioned on Body Gestures**
  - **Neuro-steered Speaker Extraction Conditioned on EEG Signals**

### 3. **SpeechScore**  
<a href="https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/speechscore">`SpeechScore`<a/> is a speech quality assessment toolkit. We include it here to evaluate different model performance. SpeechScore includes many popular speech metrics:

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)
- Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI)
- Deep Noise Suppression Mean Opinion Score (DNSMOS)
- Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR)
- and many more quality benchmarks
